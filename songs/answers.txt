1) If Spotify determines the audio aura by looking at the avg energy, valence, and danceability of a personâ€™s top 100 songs,
    then this particular user (in general) listens to songs that have catchy tunes and danceable music
    (average danceability and energy are on the higher end), but the valence of the songs is pretty much averge (~0.48),
    meaning neither euphoric nor depressive moods expressed by the music.

2) Probably expanding the criteria list would help, like adding loudness of the songs and their speechiness into the equation.
    I would consider speechiness particularly important, because preferring lyrical songs like rap songs over
    purely instrumental ones like orchestral music (or vice versa) can also help infer a lot about the characteristics of the user.
    Another addition would be the number of times the user has listened to the same song over a certain period of time, indicating
    either a wide variety of emotions radiated by the song, or a specific type of mood the user has been in during the set period.
